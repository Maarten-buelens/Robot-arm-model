# Robot arm 3d models

Made almost all models my self.\
All assemblies are made using constraits so should be fairly customizable.

Except the gripper: thanks to 4ndreas for his Mantis Gripper [link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1480408).\
And Richard Sims for his parametric GT2 pulley design [link](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/inventor-gt2-pulley-generator/372303/2).
